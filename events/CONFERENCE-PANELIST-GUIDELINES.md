## Introduction

By participating as a panelist, you agree to the OpenSearch [Code of Conduct](https://opensearch.org/codeofconduct.html) and The Linux Foundation [volunteer guidelines](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/program-committee-event-volunteer-guidelines/#overview).


## Recruiting Panelists

Prospective panelists are contacted by a panel administrator with the goal of selecting a diverse set of panelists who are familiar with the OpenSearch Project software and its community of users and contributors. These panelists will be responsible for scoring submissions based on what will make the conference an inspiring, relevant educational experience for everyone.

## Call for Presentations

During the ‘Call for Presentations’ time frame, the community is asked to submit presentation ideas across four different categories:

* **Search**: Connect with other search and relevance practitioners with demos, deep dives, or new and novel techniques for building rich search applications.
* **Analytics, Security, and Observability**: Deploying observability tools at scale? Using OpenSearch to turn log data into insights, or to help protect your infrastructure? We want to hear from you!
* **Community**: Engage a community of builders on a topic that means something to you. Anything that might educate and inspire a community of open source technologists is up for consideration here.
* **Operating OpenSearch**: Have you have built out an implementation of OpenSearch? Do you use OpenSearch in a solution that helps your own business or project? Share how you operate OpenSearch

The submissions include a topic and abstract. Once the submission process is complete and is closed, panels are formed to evaluate which talks will make it through. 

## Evaluating Presentations

Judging is done in a ‘double-blind’ state; panelists do not know presenters names, nor are they aware of other individuals on each panel and how those individuals may be scoring the submissions. If a panelist has submitted for the conference, they will not serve on the panel that judges their submission, but may serve on another panel. Depending on the number of submissions, a conference will typically have 4 to 5 different panels, each consisting of 5+ individuals from the community. 

**Panel administrator/community manager**

* Single individual or small team that knows who panelists are and their assignments. 
* Responsible for ensuring panelists are not knowingly judging submissions from individuals from the same company. 
* Aims to ensure the final selection represents a diverse cross-section of the OpenSearch community, including gender diversity, company and project diversity, and geo-diversity.

**What a panelist is scoring for:**

* Presentation looks like it would be relevant for current users or builders of OpenSearch
* Appropriate technical depth
* Sparks innovation and/or inspires 
* Has practical or actionable insights
* Presents a novel or unique perspective
* Is not a sales pitch

OpenSearchCon will utilize a [Stars rating evaluation plan](https://sessionize.com/playbook/stars-rating-evaluation-mode-guide), and panelists will score presentations based on each of the criteria listed above, as opposed to a singular overall rating. 
In addition, it is mandatory to provide feedback in the form of a comment for each presentation. Ensure your feedback is constructive, particularly for rejected proposals, as we receive requests for feedback, and it is always helpful to pass along helpful comments for future proposals.

Panelists can anticipate spending up to eight hours reviewing the assigned submissions, depending on how many are assigned. If the assignment is too large, or if a panelist foresees being unable to complete their assignment, they are obligated to notify the panel administration team as early as possible to allow their talks to be reassigned. 

Panelists are expected to keep their involvement, the submissions they review, and their comments confidential. This helps ensure the integrity of the conference and earn community trust. Panelists are also asked to evaluate submissions with the best interests of the OpenSearch Project and the conference attendees as their priority, rather than from the perspective of their employer or their own business interests. Panelists should judge as if they are an attendee and are looking to build a compelling and diverse set of sessions they would want to attend. Remember that the audience will contain a wide array of interests and levels of expertise. 

Once the scoring is completed, the panel administrator(s) will collect the scores, topics, and panelists’ inputs and compile the final roster of speakers and presentations. As part of this process, the administrator(s) may adjust the final selections with the goals of ensuring diversity of speakers and content and supporting the best possible conference.
