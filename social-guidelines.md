# Social Media Guidelines


This document covers the social media guidelines for administering and posting on the OpenSearch Project social media accounts. 

The OpenSearch Project & the OpenSearch Software Foundation manage multiple social media accounts. These guidelines are intended to apply to all OpenSearch channels, regardless of who may be acting as manager at a given time.


## OpenSearch Project social handles

### Objectives

The objectives of the project’s social media presences are:

* Build awareness for the project
* Drive engagement and participation in the project
* Share project news, roadmap updates, news releases
* Educate on project updates
* Update the community on upcoming events and user groups
* Promote OpenSearchCon conferences or other first-party events
* Share information on how-tos, demos, or other product information that is of interest to the community
* Promote membership in the OpenSearch Software Foundation


### Strategy and Guidelines

* Keep messages positive and uplifting, consistent with the values and principles of the OpenSearch Project and OpenSearch Software Foundation
* Share content that benefits the ecosystem as a whole
* Share vendor-neutral, community-sourced posts that are informational, engaging, and ecosystem-focused
* Engage with the community through re-shares/boosts/retweets and sharing of community content
* Shared vendor-neutral content, sourced from contributors, maintainers, ambassadors, news outlets, etc that spreads awareness to the community
* Shared content including blog posts, news coverage, thought leadership bylines, technology demos, GitHub work, User Group meetups, etc
* Social posts from member company handles and/or vendor channels can be shared
* Activities that are hosted by and open to the public can be promoted, to benefit the ecosystem as a whole


### Images & Videos

Images shared, unless specifically credited back to a community member, will meet the requirements of “free for commercial use” and “no attribution required.”


### Technical assistance

Community members replying to social posts, requesting technical assistance or troubleshooting are requested to open a new topic on the [forum](https://forum.opensearch.org/) or join the [Slack](https://opensearch.org/slack.html) instance and ask in one relevant channel (see [COMMUNICATIONS.md](https://github.com/opensearch-project/community/blob/main/COMMUNICATIONS.md) for further information). 

### Hashtags

OpenSearch uses hashtags in our posts:

* To measure the success of campaigns (for example, #OpenSearchCon);
* To expand our reach beyond our current followers and tap into larger, trending topics on Twitter (for example, #opensource)
* To organize or categorize shares (for example, #search, #o11y, #security, #analytics, etc).


### Code of Conduct

All social media messages are expected to follow the [OpenSearch Project Code of Conduct](https://github.com/opensearch-project/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
